Rotary encoders are popular input devices that can be used to measure and control the position and rotation of a shaft. The Raspberry Pi Pico, with its GPIO pins and capabilities, provides an excellent platform for integrating a rotary encoder into your projects. In this step-by-step guide, we will walk through the process of connecting a rotary encoder to the Raspberry Pi Pico and writing the code to read and interpret its input
