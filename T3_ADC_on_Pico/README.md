Hey everyone, In this tutorial we are going to perform [ADC](https://circuitdigest.com/tags/adc) on the Pico board. In this tutorial we will perform an ADC conversion with the Pico board. The Raspberry Pi Pico has 4 ADC channels with 12-bit resolution but one ADC channel is connected to the internal temperature sensor. And the rest of all ADCs can be found at the GPIO26, GPIO27 and GPIO28 as ADC0, ADC1 and ADC2 respectively. You can refer the below image where I marked the ADC pins in red colored.
