Hey everyone, in this tutorial we are going to interface a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) module with the Raspberry Pi Pico using Micropython. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to display strings, characters on the LCD using Micropython. Previously we have worked with an OLED display and we have seen the I2C and ADC on the Raspberry Pi Pico. Now, letâ€™s see how to interface an LCD display module with the pico board.
