# Interface ESP8266-01 Wi-Fi Module with Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython



<br>
We know that ESP-01 is the best and cheaper module available in the market. As the title suggest, in this tutorial, we are going to interface a separate Wi-Fi module with the Raspberry Pi Pico. We will learn how to connect and program the ESP01 module with Raspberry Pi Pico using Micropython and ESP8266 library. 

The ESP8266-01 module comes with default firmware loaded, which we can access through UART by sending the AT command sets. Using the Micropython ESP8266 we can easily interface ESP8266 with Raspberry Pi Pico and complete the http get/post operation.
