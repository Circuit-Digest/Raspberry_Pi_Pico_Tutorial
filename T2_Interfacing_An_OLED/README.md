Hey everyone, In this tutorial we are going to interface an [OLED display module](https://circuitdigest.com/tags/oled) with the Pico board. You will be able to perform an I2C communication on Raspberry Pi Pico at the end of this tutorial. In this tutorial we are going to display some strings and images on the OLED display by using Micropython. We already have some articles and projects on Interfacing of the OLED display. You can refer those articles and projects before to get a proper idea on the working of an OLED display.
