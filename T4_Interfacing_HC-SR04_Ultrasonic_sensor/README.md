Hey everyone welcome back to the another tutorial of the Raspberry Pi Pico. If you are following our Raspberry Pi Pico tutorial series, then you should know that we have covered how to interface an OLED display module with pico board and We have measured the ADC value from the ADC channel of the pico board. In this tutorial we will interface an [Ultrasonic Sensor](https://circuitdigest.com/tags/ultrasonic-sensor)  with the pico board and we are going to measure the distance of an object and then we will display the distance on the OLED display module using MicroPython.
